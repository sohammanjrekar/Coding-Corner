# RESTAPIDocs Examples

These examples were taken from projects mainly using [Django Rest
Framework](https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework) and so the
JSON responses are often similar to the way in which DRF makes responses.

Where full URLs are provided in responses they will be rendered as if service
is running on 'http://testserver/'.
