// The following line is commented out, so it will not execute.
// It is equivalent to the second line but written with the 'window' object explicitly.
// window.alert("Hello World");  // This does the same thing as alert().

// This is the working code that triggers a simple popup alert box with a message.
alert("Hello World");

/*
 * Explanation:
 * - `alert()` is a built-in JavaScript function that displays a message inside a modal dialog box (popup).
 * - The dialog box consists of a message, an "OK" button, and a close (X) button in the corner.
 * 
 * How `alert()` works:
 * - When `alert()` is called, it pauses the script execution until the user interacts with the dialog (by clicking the "OK" button).
 * - The message passed to the `alert()` function is displayed inside the popup.
 * - If the user clicks "OK", the alert box closes, and the script execution continues.
 *
 * Syntax: 
 * alert(message);
 * - `message`: The text or content to display in the alert box. This can be a string or any data type (it will be converted to a string).
 * 
 * Example:
 * - `alert("Hello World")`: A popup will display the message "Hello World".
 * - `alert(123)`: Even though `123` is a number, it will be converted to a string and displayed as `"123"`.
 * 
 * Common use cases:
 * - **Debugging**: Developers often use `alert()` to check the value of variables or outputs at certain points in the code.
 * - **User notifications**: Simple alerts to notify the user of important information (though modern web development prefers custom popups or modal dialogs for better user experience).
 * 
 * Example:
 * alert("You have successfully logged in!");
 * alert("Form submission failed! Please try again.");
 *
 * `window.alert()` vs `alert()`:
 * - `alert()` is a method of the `window` object in JavaScript. In a browser environment, the `window` object is global, meaning you don't need to explicitly reference `window` when calling `alert()`.
 * - `window.alert()` and `alert()` are functionally equivalent, but `alert()` is the shorthand and preferred method.
 * 
 * Considerations:
 * - **Blocking behavior**: 
 *     - `alert()` is **synchronous**, which means it **blocks further code execution** until the user interacts with the alert.
 *     - This can be useful when you want the user to acknowledge something before proceeding, but it can disrupt the flow of a web application.
 *     - As a result, `alert()` is generally not recommended for production web applications because it can feel intrusive.
 * 
 * Example of blocking behavior:
 * ```javascript
 * alert("Processing your request...");
 * console.log("This will not run until the user clicks OK.");
 * ```
 * - **Compatibility**: `alert()` is supported by all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), so there's no compatibility issue in basic web applications.
 * 
 * Alternatives to `alert()`:
 * - In modern web development, instead of using `alert()`, developers prefer creating custom modal dialogs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a better user experience.
 * - Custom modals allow more control over the appearance, behavior, and styling of the popup, and do not block code execution like `alert()` does.
 * 
 * Example of a custom modal (in HTML/CSS/JS):
 * ```html
 * <div id="myModal" class="modal">
 *     <div class="modal-content">
 *         <span class="close">&times;</span>
 *         <p>This is a custom modal dialog!</p>
 *     </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * ```javascript
 * // Open the custom modal
 * document.getElementById("myModal").style.display = "block";
 * 
 * // Close the modal
 * document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0].onclick = function() {
 *     document.getElementById("myModal").style.display = "none";
 * };
 * ```
 * - Custom modals are more flexible and allow for richer content, such as buttons, images, or form fields.
 * 
 * Example of using `alert()` for debugging:
 * ```javascript
 * let age = 25;
 * alert("The user's age is: " + age); // Displays an alert with the value of the 'age' variable
 * ```
 * - This can be helpful in a development environment for testing values at various points in the code.
 * 
 * More information:
 * - `alert()` can display more complex data, including arrays and objects, though everything is converted to a string:
 * ```javascript
 * let user = {name: "John", age: 30};
 * alert(user);  // Outputs: "[object Object]"
 * ```
 * - To display the contents of objects or arrays clearly, you can use `JSON.stringify()`:
 * ```javascript
 * let user = {name: "John", age: 30};
 * alert(JSON.stringify(user));  // Outputs: '{"name":"John","age":30}'
 * ```
 * 
 * Best Practices:
 * - **Avoid overuse**: Avoid using `alert()` too frequently in production code, as it can disrupt the user's experience. Itâ€™s better to use it for debugging during development or for very short notifications.
 * - **Custom user messages**: For user notifications or messages, consider using custom modals or toast notifications.
 * - **Accessibility considerations**: When using alerts, make sure the user is not overwhelmed or annoyed by excessive popups. Additionally, consider how screen readers and keyboard navigation might interact with the alert.
