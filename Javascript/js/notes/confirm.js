// The `confirm()` method displays a dialog box with a specified message, an "OK" button, and a "Cancel" button.
let result = confirm("Are you sure you want to proceed?");

console.log(result); // Logs 'true' if the user clicked "OK", 'false' if the user clicked "Cancel"

/*
 * Explanation:
 * 1. `confirm()` is a built-in JavaScript function that shows a dialog box with a message and two buttons: OK and Cancel.
 * 2. The user can click the "OK" button or the "Cancel" button:
 *    - If the user clicks "OK", `confirm()` returns `true`.
 *    - If the user clicks "Cancel", `confirm()` returns `false`.
 * 3. This is useful when you need to ask the user to confirm an action, such as deleting something or proceeding with a sensitive task.
 *
 * Syntax:
 * confirm(message);
 * - `message`: The message to display in the confirm dialog box. It should be a string.
 *
 * Example:
 * - If the user clicks "OK", the result will be `true`.
 * - If the user clicks "Cancel", the result will be `false`.
 */

// Check the user's response and log the appropriate message
if (result === true) {
    console.log("User confirmed the action.");
} else {
    console.log("User canceled the action.");
}

/*
 * More details about `confirm()`:
 * - Syntax: confirm(message);
 * - `message`: A string that will be displayed in the dialog box. This is required.
 * - The return value is:
 *    - `true` if the user clicks "OK".
 *    - `false` if the user clicks "Cancel".
 * - `confirm()` is synchronous, meaning it will block the execution of the rest of the code until the user responds.
 *
 * Example with a conditional statement:
 * ```javascript
 * let isConfirmed = confirm("Do you really want to delete this item?");
 * if (isConfirmed) {
 *     console.log("Item will be deleted.");
 * } else {
 *     console.log("Item deletion canceled.");
 * }
 * ```

// Example of using `confirm()` to ask if the user wants to delete something
let deleteItem = confirm("Do you want to delete this item?");
if (deleteItem) {
    console.log("Item deleted.");
} else {
    console.log("Item not deleted.");
}

/*
 * More details:
 * - `confirm()` can be used for any scenario where you need to ask the user for a confirmation.
 * - Typical use cases include confirming an action, such as deleting an item or navigating away from a page.
 *
 * Example with type conversion (confirming a number):
 * let isConfirmed = confirm("Is 10 greater than 5?");
 * console.log(isConfirmed); // Logs 'true' if the user clicked OK, 'false' if Cancel
 */

// Example of using `confirm()` for a yes/no style question
let isStudent = confirm("Are you a student?");
if (isStudent) {
    console.log("User is a student.");
} else {
    console.log("User is not a student.");
}

/*
 * Possible pitfalls and things to consider when using `confirm()`:
 * - `confirm()` blocks the execution of JavaScript until the user interacts with the dialog.
 * - Always consider what happens when the user clicks "Cancel". Make sure to handle that case appropriately.
 * - `confirm()` is a simple modal dialog and may feel intrusive in production applications, so it's better to use custom modals or UI components for a better user experience.
 * - If you need more complex interactions or controls, consider using custom modal dialogs.

// Example of blocking behavior:
// The following code will block until the user clicks either "OK" or "Cancel".
let proceed = confirm("Do you want to continue with the purchase?");
if (proceed) {
    console.log("User confirmed the purchase.");
} else {
    console.log("User canceled the purchase.");
}
